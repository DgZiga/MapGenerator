# WaveFunctionCollaps
Implementation of [wfc algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) aimed at producing pokémon maps.

Currently demo maps from Pokémon Odyssey are loaded in, a simple algorithm find a walkable path from one edge of the map to the other and wfc fills in the gaps

## TODOS:
- tackle bigger maps (maybe tiling the map?)
- find a better path algorithm
