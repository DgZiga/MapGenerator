# WaveFunctionCollaps
Implementation of [https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse](wfc algorithm) aimed at producing pok√©mon maps.

## TODOS:
- for any given tileset, figure out if they are "walkable"
- generate a random path across the map area from one edge tile to another
- pre-load the output tilemaps with superpositions of "walkable" tiles in the random path position
